# Bayesian-Inference
This repository contains the works that use Bayesian methods.


The process of Bayesian data analysis can be splited into 3 steps :   
1 **Set up a probability model** for observed and unobserved variables. The model should be consitent with knowlegde about the underlying scientific problem, and the data collection process.   
2 **Evaluate a posterior distribution** on observed dataset.   
3 **Interpret the model** : how well does the model fit the data ? How sensitive are the results to modeling assumptions.
